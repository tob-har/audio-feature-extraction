# Audio feature extraction workspace

Use the timbreID_Workspace.pd patch to explore audio feature extraction using
the timbreID external and timbreID library for Pure data.

[Pure data](http://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data) Vanilla (Version 0.50-2) and the [timbreID](https://github.com/wbrent/timbreID) external are necessary for this patch to work.

timbreID_Wokspace.pd is documented inside the patch.

amenbreak.wav is provided as initial audio file loaded by the patch an must be placed in the same directory then the timbreID_Workspace.

Audio file playback, audio input, three different trigger objects, single- and multi-feature analyzer templates
and a feature-list-builder are ready to use.

timbre ID itsef is not fully integrated yet... need some more time on this...
